HI!

I am Aravind Varma, an engineer learning to program software (currently android applications only) and I have created an app that allows users to store and share memories. I have solely developed and designed the app myself by reading books/blogs, visiting websites but most importantly, by being perseverant.

Although I have written this code without having a degree in computer science or any related field, I have implemented clean coding practices. I make sure that I make the code readable, reusable and maintainable. After all, programming is a language and there is an art in expressing it. I agree I do not have experience in the industry but I am confident I can catch up in no time. I learned how to use Git and Github and started documentation generated through JavaDoc. Currently, I am learning to implement unit tests for my current (and future) project(s).

It would be appreciated if you could support me by advising me in writing efficient code or directing me to the right resources that would help me out. (For example, I leanred about Git by browsing through reddit and it really saved me a lot of effort and time. Is there any technology that I should be learning)

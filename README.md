HI !

I am Aravind Varma, an engineer learning to program software (currently android applications only). I have created an app ( unpublished at the time of writing) which allows users to store memories. These memories consist of photos/videos with an optional title, description, date/time settings and categorise them into events such as student life, work, birthdays. Users can store a record of such memories, search by title or filter by event and share them on social platforms.

Although I have written this code by myself, I have implemented clean coding practices. Once I have added a feature or removed a bug, I make sure that I clean the code by making it readable, enforcing reusability, and effortlessly maintain for anyone who has just visited it. Afterall, programming is a language and there is an art in expressing it.

I do not have a degree in computer science/IT/programming which makes me difficult to even get to the interview stage of a job/internship. I agree I do not have experience in the industry but I am confident of catching up in no time. I learned how to use Git and Github and started writing documentation through JavaDoc. Currently I am learning to implement unit tests for my current (and future) project(s).

It would be really appreciated if you could support me by giving advice in writing efficient code or directing me to the right resources that would make me an effective software engineer.

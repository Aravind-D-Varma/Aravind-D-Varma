HI !

I am Aravind Varma, an engineer learning to program software (currently android applications only). I have created an app ( unpublished at the time of writing) that allows users to store and share memories.

Although I have written this code by myself, I have implemented clean coding practices. I make sure that I clean the code by making it readable, enforcing reusability, and effortlessly maintain it for anyone who has just visited it. After all, programming is a language and there is an art in expressing it.

I do not have a degree in computer science/IT/programming which makes it difficult to even get to the interview stage of a job/internship. I agree I do not have experience in the industry but I am confident I can catch up in no time. I learned how to use Git and Github and started writing documentation through JavaDoc. Currently, I am learning to implement unit tests for my current (and future) project(s).

It would be really appreciated if you could support me by giving advice in writing efficient code or directing me to the right resources that would make me an effective software engineer.
